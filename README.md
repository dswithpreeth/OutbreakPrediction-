## Outbreak Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Abstract
Outbreak prediction using machine learning explores the potential of machine learning algorithms in outbreak prediction, aiming to harness their data-driven insights for more effective public health preparedness and response. This study outlines a comprehensive strategy aimed at enhancing the prediction and understanding of future disease outbreaks. Our approach integrates a dynamic social network model with the established SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) epidemiological framework, accounting for person-to-person interactions. Leveraging shared features from diverse pandemics, we develop a robust machine learning model for outbreak forecasting. Additionally, we conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on healthcare datasets, including Electronic Health Records (EHR), to extract valuable insights and provide a statistical summary of the outbreaks.

Incorporating cloud-based methods, we utilize publicly available datasets from Johns Hopkins University research, ensuring the credibility and reliability of our data sources. Furthermore, we employ Power BI dashboards and Python programming for data visualization and analysis, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of our research process. This multifaceted approach, combining epidemiological modeling, machine learning techniques, and cloud-based data analysis, contributes to improving our preparedness for impending pandemics and underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in public health research.
